## What are the pros and cons of TDD?

By utilizing Test-Driven Development, it helps develop more reliable software because it forces developers to prioritize creating comprehensive tests, whereas usually testing is a last thought that occurs near the end of a project (if at all). Also, it can lead to well thought-out and therefore more robust software design, because writing the tests first helps developers to think about the interface and exactly what the expected results of the code they write are. Finally, by writing tests first, it can help developers to catch bugs or logical flaws in their code very early-on. However, TDD also includes some flaws that may outweigh the pros depending on the team and their goals. TDD forces developers to invest a significant amount of time in the beginning to design and create tests before starting development, which can be a problem for teams with strict, upcoming deadlines. Even though taking this time in the beginning to fully flesh out the code and the expected results can actually save time in the long run, it may be better for teams with an upcoming deadline to get a minimum viable product working, before going back and making tests. Also, another con is that there could be significant amount of test rewriting, if along the project there is a change in the code that impacts the expected results. Then, the developers may have wasted time if the old tests that were defined in the beginning of the project are no longer valid.
